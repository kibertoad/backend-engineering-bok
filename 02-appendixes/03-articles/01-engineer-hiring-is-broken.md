Our industry is enamoured with algorithms when it comes to hiring engineers. All the big players, such as Facebook, Google and Uber open with phone screening that revolves around applying one of the common algorithms to solve a problem, and close with a whiteboard test that observes your "problem solving skills", which in practice mean spending plenty of time up-front rehearsing that one algorithm that is applicable to an artifically picked problem out of a larger list of industry-approved algorithms.

One problem? This style of interviewing does not correlate with high performance. Here is a good reading on this topic: https://www.qualified.io/blog/posts/truly-predictive-software-engineering-interviews

Common fallacy is thinking that being good at solving algorithmic exercise

Problem is, it identifies very specific blend of smart people who are not necessarily going to bring the most value to your business.

One metaphor that I find useful is this. Imagine that you are organizing a dangerous mission somewhere in the jungle. You are picking candidates for the job, and the main criteria is how good they are at fencing. There is at least some ratio behind that - people who are into fencing are likely to be generally fit, somewhat adventureous and likely capable to defend themselves. However, when going on a dangerous mission in the jungle, personally I would very much prefer having a doctor, a guide and a translator on the team, and not just four brilliant fencers, however great they might be at their craft.

Usual result of biasing your hiring process on the side of hiring algorithmicaly strong developers is that after you have a critical mass of such people, they are going to become the backbone of your engineering culture, and it will be difficult to hire any other kind of people, as your interviews will be designed and conducted primarily by the engineers who will see algorithmic proficiency as the bare minimum qualifying competency, and a synthetic whiteboard exercise as a mandatory rite of passage. This is going to harm candidate pool available for your company tremendously, and you will miss many highly valuable candidates as a result.

 It is important to acknowledge other, different types of high performing engineers. Bart Butler, a CTO of ProtonMail, once said, that when hiring, he is looking for one of the two in the candidate: either a sharp mind of a problem solver, or a structured discipline of a caretaker. I like to call these two fundamentally different roles "rocket scientist" and "gardener".

"Rocket scientists" tend to focus on what needs to be achieved. Usually they are great at quickly implementing new features optimizing the performance of your application. However, they tend to write messy code, avoid writing tests and documentation, are often averse to most forms of knowledge sharing and if left unchecked, will make technical debt of your project go over the roof. Since they are usually very smart, they have no need for simplifying their solutions, as clever one-liners and large uninterrupted blocks of code are perfectly readable by them, at the expense of the rest of the team.
"Gardeners", on the other hand, focus on keeping things orderly. They refactor the code, they are knowledgeable of design patterns and idiomatic usage of languages and frameworks, they write tests and fill documentation gaps when they stumble upon them. Since they are often not as smart and quick as rocket scientists are, their code is more deliberately designed to reduce cognitive load of reading it.

In order for your team to be successful, you need both; rocket scientists to push for an ambitious, daring solutions, and gardeners to ensure sustainability and efficiency in your approach. However, unfortunately, our industry currently is clearly biased towards hiring rocket scientists. There were some very interesting experiments with shifting candidate assessment towards more pragmatic aspects of their working style by Microsoft and Wix (
