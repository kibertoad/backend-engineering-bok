Backend Engineering Body of Knowledge

## Introduction to BEBOK

In this document we attempt to establish a pragmatic, non-exhaustive baseline for the body of knowledge for the field of backend software engineering.

BEBOK is intended to be used as a basis for deriving competency requirements for candidate interviewing and performance review purposes. It is not a rigorous academic study and is not intended to be one; rather than that, it aims to advise hiring and line managers, as well as training providers as well as aspiring developers with practical guidance with regards to skills and knowledge that have major impact on developer performance in real-world scenarios.

BEBOK is not meant to be a replacement for the "Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge" (SWEBOK), which we still recommend as the definitive source for high-level structural overview of the whole software engineering discipline. We do, however, find that is overly broad for direct practical application in business context, which is why this document was written. There is inevitable overlap with the material presented in SWEBOK, but we did our best not to duplicate the effort and reference existing work instead whenever possible.

Note that some of the industries have more specific demands than the others, notably in machine learning and data analysis fields. BEBOK aims not to cover as wide ground as possible, but on the opposite - highlight the narrowest possible common denominator of what brings the most value. We envision that more focused, per-industry extensions to the core BEBOK might make sense in the future.

## Criteria for topic selection

BEBOK is oriented at identifying challenges and competencies, relevant to backend engineers ranging from junior to senior level, but not including team lead, principal engineer or above levels, as all of those positions tend to lean into more interdisciplinary territory, with more of management and strategy setting responsibilities entering the picture, and taking these into consideration would harm the focus of BEBOK.

First and foremost BEBOK addresses tactical needs of _actually building software in an effective, efficient, sustainable and maintainable way.

These are the four core values that BEBOK focuses on:

1) Effective: delivering expected business value on time and under budget;
2) Efficient: deliver maximum possible value under minimal possible cost;
3) Sustainable: ensure consistent delivery of value over longer periods time, avoid delivery speed deterioration;
4) Maintainable: ensure lowest possible cost of servicing built systems and onboarding new team members.  

## Structure of the BEBOK

BEBOK is split into knowledge areas (KA), each of which consists of topics, challenges, solutions and references.

1) Topics identify
2) Challenges describe real-world complications that have to be overcome by software engineers in order to deliver expected business value;
3) Solutions describe best practices, proposed within the industry to address listed challenges;
4) References provide additional materials (books, articles, videos) that discuss identified topics, challenges and solutions in greater detail.

Additional articles are provided in `appendixes` section. These provide recommendations practical application of BEBOK as well as some anecdotal materials, that shed additional light on topics, covered by BEBOK.
